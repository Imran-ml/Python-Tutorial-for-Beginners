## Introduction

Python is a popular high-level programming language that is used for a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, scientific computing, and more. It was created in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum, and has since become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world.

This tutorial is an introduction to Python and the `numpy` library for
those who are already familiar with programming in another language.

In this tutorial, we will cover:

-   Basic Python: Basic data types, Containers (Lists, Dictionaries,,
    Tuples), Control Flow Statements, Errors and Exceptions, Functions,
    Classes
-   `numpy`: Arrays, Array indexing, Datatypes, Array math, Broadcasting
-   `matplotlib`: Basic Visualization, Subplots, Image Visualization

## Environment Setup

**Prerequisites**: Ensure Python 3.6 or newer is installed on your system.

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    - Install `virtualenv` if you prefer it over the built-in `venv` (optional):
        ```bash
        pip install virtualenv
        ```
    - Create the environment:
        - With `venv` (Python 3.3+):
            ```bash
            python -m venv env
            ```
        - Or, with `virtualenv`:
            ```bash
            virtualenv env
            ```
    - Activate the environment:
        - Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`
        - Unix/MacOS: `source env/bin/activate`
    - To deactivate: `deactivate`

2. **Dependencies**:
    Ensure all dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
